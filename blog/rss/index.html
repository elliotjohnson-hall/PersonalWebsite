Literature and language, art, reasoned debate - are just a few of the things that set us apart from the rest of the animal kingdom as humans. The unifying factor in all these activities is our complex brain.</p><p>Now, new research has revealed one way in which our brains differ from those of our close relatives. The paper,<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04230-7"> published in <em>Nature</em></a>, emerged from UCSF in California, and reveals human brain is unique within the first trimester.</p><p>Rodents and humans have incredibly different brains. Yet most prior research used rodents to try and understand the complexity of human brains. Understandably, studying live human brains in a lab is ethically prohibited. Modern techniques have now enabled scientists to grow human brain cells in a dish to explore how the human brain differs from animals.</p><p>Cells multiply by dividing: one cell splits into two. During this division, a cell&#x2019;s offspring can take on new characteristics. Following an individual cell&#x2019;s descendants is relatively simple. However, the problem of scale remained; human brains are made of tens of billions of cells which mature and interact to give rise to our human experience.</p><p>The researchers&#x2019; challenge was how to track the offspring of many cells simultaneously. By developing a new way to &#x2018;barcode&#x2019; individual cells, Delgado and colleagues were able to follow thousands of cells and their descendants over long time periods.</p><p>In rodents, two types of brain cells - <em>excitatory </em>and <em>inhibitory </em>are born in different places within the brain, from different cell families. In contrast, both excitatory and inhibitory human brain cells are born from the same cells in the same location.</p><p>Overall, this work has revealed another way in which the human brain is set apart from those of other species.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="blob:http://localhost:2368/80c4e90a-42bc-47ff-951e-b3c343d5cc41" class="kg-image" alt="page2image48856512" loading="lazy"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="blob:http://localhost:2368/1019b6d6-a5db-47c5-9553-6e2e9b265cc1" class="kg-image" alt="page3image49040224" loading="lazy" width="451" height="316"></figure><p><em>In rodents, excitatory (green) and inhibitory (red) brain cells are born from two different types of cell (pink &amp; yellow).

The study, published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-23062-6">Nature Scientific Reports</a> in 2018, found the interstitial space was vastly different to the prevailing view.</p><p>The research team - led by the Mount Sinai Beth Israel Medical Center in New York - have found evidence that changes the way scientists and doctors think about the interstitial space. This opens doors for potential new research into treatments for cancer, amongst other diseases.</p><p>Due to the way tissues are prepared for the microscope the interstitial space appeared as a flat bundle of collagen fibres adhered together. With the authors&#x2019; new insights, this has been shown to be an artefact - not how the interstitial space looks in life. By injecting a fluorescent dye into the patients circulatory system, the authors could use a probe-mounted laser to illuminate the space in the living human body. This showed a series of fluid-filled canals that regulate the flow of lymph around the body.</p><p>Lymph is a key body fluid; blood&#x2019;s lesser known companion in your body. Lymph circulates through the body through a network of vessels and nodes and plays a role in many functions from the immune system to digestion. It is well known that some tumours are able to metastasise (spread) throughout the body in the lymphatic system, but precise mechanisms have not yet been found.</p><p>After the 12 patients surgeries were completed the researchers quickly froze sections of this tissue. This allowed the interstitial space to keep its hollow shape when viewed under the microscope.</p><p>The interstitial space is not a passive organ either. Its structure suggests that it actively pumps lymph around the body. For cancer cells that make it through to the interstitial space, this effectively acts as a cellular motorway allowing the cancer to spread rapidly throughout the body. This is typical of some bowel and skin cancers.</p><p><em>A diagram of some of the potential interstitial spaces in the body (from the original paper).</em></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="blob:http://localhost:2368/58384766-4723-4640-9d19-b768f051faec" class="kg-image" alt="page2image48882624" loading="lazy" width="375" height="300"></figure><p>Benias, P.C., Wells, R.G., Sackey-Aboagye, B. <em>et al. </em>Structure and Distribution of an Unrecognized Interstitium in Human Tissues. <em>Sci Rep </em><strong>8</strong>, 4947 (2018).</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Three-person embryos develop normally]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>In 2016, it was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-37485263">revealed</a> that a child had been born with the DNA of three people.

Generally, the combination of sperm and egg leads to a complete genetic make up of an individual - the genome. However, there is more to the story than it first seems. Mitochondria (yes, the <em>powerhouse of the cell</em>) are only ever transferred from the egg. </p><p>This is why we can trace back all humans to <em>Mitochnodrial Eve</em> - the origin of everyone&apos;s mitochnodria. Mitochondria are passed along in a direct female line; you inherit your mother&apos;s mitochondria, as she inherited your grandmother&apos;s. </p><p>Inherited mitochondrial diseases are often severe and fatal. With a dysfunction of the processes the produce energy within our cells there is little to no hope of a normal life. These diseases are genetic, but not passed down thorugh the nuclear DNA that determines your eye colour. Instead, mitochondria contain their own DNA.</p><p>The key to this story is that mitochondria are only ever transferred through the mother&apos;s egg. This gave researchers the idea to extract the nucleus and leave the other organelles - including mitochondria - behind.</p><p>By removing the mother&apos;s egg&apos;s nucleus, and transplanting it into a donor egg that has had its nucleus removed before fertilising the hybrid egg <em>in vitro</em>, researchers have found they can prevent the mitochiondrial disease being inherited. It was this process that lead to a birth in China in 2016.</p><p>At the time, the scientific community was generally sceptical. This was new technology that was untested being used in humans for the first time.</p><p>Now, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001741">researchers have observed</a> that human embryos developing from this technique appear normal and function as expected. Although, it is important to caveat this technique needs further refinment and validation before it would be accepted in the UK. </p><p>Nevertheless, this is a hugely exciting piece of research that may help to eliminate diseases which cause hige suffering for patients born with them and their families.</p><p>Qi S, Wang W, Xue X, Lu Z, Yan J, et al.

Sperm meets egg and then suddenly these two cells fuse. Now in their place is an embryo. This basic pattern has been unchanged throughout history - until now. Researchers in two groups have created mouse embryos without sperm or eggs: termed &apos;synthetic embryos&apos; or &apos;embryoids&apos;.</p><p>These synthetic embryos bring many advantages over conventional embryos. Firstly, they develop outside the uterus so researchers can see and manipulate the embryos far more easily. Secondly, they can help reduce researchers&apos; reliance on animals for experiments.</p><p>The first group - based in Cambridge, UK and Seattle, WA - grew their embryos in a jelly-like substance called matrigel. According to their upcoming paper in the scientific journal <em>Nature</em>, the group&apos;s developing embryos resembled natural embryos closely.</p><p>The researchers observed their synthetic embryos undergoing a key event - the embryonic somersault (properly termed gastrulation). This is a defining moment in an embryo&apos;s life. Essentially, the embryo is comprised of three separate layers of cells: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. To develop properly, these layers need to be rearranged so the embryo turns itself inside-out.</p><p>The next big marker of an embryo&apos;s maturity is forming a hollow tube which will become the spinal cord. This process, known as neurulation, is hugely important. When neurulation fails severe birth defects such as spina bifida or death result. The researchers&apos; synthetic embryos were able to nerulate correctly.</p><p>Furthermore, the final synthetic embryos developed a complete brain, primitive spinal cord, a beating heart, blood, and a gut tube. &#xA0;The synthetic embryos also contained developing blocks of muscle known as somites. These are key markers of a full and complete embryo.</p><p>The researchers used their synthetic embryos to manipulate a key developmental gene known as <em>Pax6</em>. <em>Pax6</em> is particularly important for eye development; individuals with a mutation in this gene can be born without the coloured iris of their eyes - a condition called aniridia. By using their synthetic embryos to successfully perform these experiments with <em>Pax6</em> the researchers demonstrated they did not need to rely on animal testing. This is a huge step forward for reducing science&apos;s reliance on animals; a win for scientists, animals, and ethical groups globally.</p><p>The second group - based in Israel - performed similar experiments at a similar time and published their work in the journal <em>Cell</em>. This group also relied on stem cells to produce their synthetic embryos but grew their embryos in a specially-designed glass bottles in a liquid medium.</p><p>This group also found that their synthetic embryos developed in a manner very similar to natural embryos. Startlingly, this group observed their embryos developed features quicker than natural embryos would. Their embryos had the characteristics of a five day old embryo at only four days old. The speed with which these embryos can develop is another bonus for researchers as it will allow them to perform their experiments faster than previously possible.</p><p>Similarly to the first group, this group observed their synthetic embryos successfully developed a variety of structures such as the brain and heart.</p><p>It is important to note that both groups had embryos which failed. However, this is no different to natural embryo development; some embryos simply fail to develop, sometimes seemingly without reason. Furthermore, these synthetic embryos are not completely identical to natural embryos but are nevertheless still remarkable.</p><p>In conclusion, this technological advance is a huge leap forward for biomedical scientists the world over. Using these synthetic embryos will allow scientists to perform key experiments to understand, prevent, and cure diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and developmental malformations. This technology will also reduce scientists&apos; reliance on animals for experiments. Finally, these studies give us a deeper insight into the processes of early embryo development and will further enhance our knowledge of this key stage of life.</p><hr><p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05246-3">Amadei, G. <em>et al.</em> Synthetic embryos complete gastrulation to neurulation and organogenesis. <em>Nature</em> (2022). </a></p><p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.07.028">Tarazi, S <em>et al.</em>, Post-gastrulation synthetic embryos generated ex utero from mouse naive ESCs, <em>Cell</em> (2022).</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
